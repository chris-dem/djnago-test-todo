# Todo list API Docs

Required packages:

## Documentation

The current API provides the following two access points

* `/todo/api` : View of the entire todo list and the addition of new todos
* `/todo/api/<id:int>` : View a specific todo, modify it or delete it

Table of operations and their end points

||`GET`| `POST`|`DELETE`| `PUT` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/todo/api` | Retrieve all todos | Create a new todo. Parameters : _title_, _description_, _status_ | --- | --- |
| `/todo/api<int:api>` | Retrieve todo with id `id` | --- | Delete todo with id `id` | Update details of specific todo. Optional parameters: : _title_, _description_, _status_|

If an invalid request is sent, the server will respond with status code `400 BAD REQUEST`

### Todo structure:

* _id_ :  Autogenerated integer field
* _title_ : Text field with max length of 100. This field should not be empty either
* _description_ : Text field with max length of 200. This field should not be empty
* _status_ : Enumerable field with values `"T", "F"`. The API will return
"Completed" or "Not completed", but the user of the api should always make sure to use either "T" or "F" when manipulating the todos.
* _timestamp\_crated_ : This field denotes the timestamp of when the todo was created
* _timestamp\_updated_ : This field denotes the timestamp of when the todo was lastly modified

## Operations

Ensure that all the modules are installed. All of the
commands are expected to be run from the root directory of project.

1. How to run : `python manage.py runserver`
2. How to test : `python manage.py test`

In case the model, is not running or missing, try the following:

1. `python manage.py makemigrations`
2. `python manage.py migrate`
